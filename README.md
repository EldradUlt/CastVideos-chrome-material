# CastVideos-material

The demo can be found [here](http://googlecast.github.io/CastVideos-material/).

This sample showcases the UX compliant Chromecast polymer elements.  The main elements are:

* [cast-video](https://github.com/googlecast/cast-video-polymer) - Handles displaying and 
controlling the video
* [cast-controller-bar](https://github.com/googlecast/cast-controller-bar-polymer) - Controls the Chromecast when the local media and chromecast media don't match.

The sub elements are:
* [cast-button](https://github.com/googlecast/cast-button-polymer) - Renders cast button and handles logic related to casting
* [cast-player-bar](https://github.com/googlecast/cast-player-bar-polymer) - Renders the local video player controls and encapsulates the cast button
* [cast-volume-controller](https://github.com/googlecast/cast-volume-controller-polymer) - Used to render the volume slider for local and cast controllers.

All of the elements are tied together using `cast.CastManager` and `core-signals`.  `cast.CastManager`
represents the current state of the app.  Each element then observes the changes in castManager to
determine how it should act.  core-signals enables pubsub functionality for events such as play,
pause, seek etc.  All of the rendering is databound so changes to castManager will be reflected 
in the UI.

This sample also supports multiple casting clients connected at the same time.  Multiple users can control the casting media and have it sync between players.

Each of the elements can be used independently, the only requirement is the chromecast-button.

The Polymer elements are meant to be a simple wrapper for Chromecast API.  Instead of integrating and rendering everything your self, you can leverage the elements to handle most of the complexity.

##Requirements

* [Bower](http://bower.io/)
* Python or a webserver

##Setup

1. Clone repo
2. `bower update`
3. `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080`
4. Open Chrome and navigate to localhost:8080
